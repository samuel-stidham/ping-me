# Tier 1: "Desktop Ping-Me" (Upgraded to Local Web App)

This directory contains the solution for the Tier 1 challenge, which was upgraded from a Command Line Interface (CLI) to a **single-page local web application** using Python and Flask. This approach provides an immediate "tiny UI," laying the groundwork for Tier 2, while still adhering to all Tier 1 core objectives.

### Core Objectives

| Objective | Status | Implementation Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Send Fixed Message** | âœ… Complete | The app sends the message "Hello from [Your Name] CLI/Web App - Tier 1 Complete!" |
| **Use Environment Variables** | âœ… Complete | Twilio credentials and phone numbers are loaded via `python-dotenv` from the ignored `.env` file. |
| **Clear Error Message** | âœ… Complete | If required environment variables are missing, the app logs a fatal error and displays an "Configuration Error" message on the web page. |
| **No Hardcoded Secrets** | âœ… Complete | All secrets are isolated to the server-side Python environment. |

### Setup and Configuration

This project uses **Poetry** for dependency management.

#### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have **Poetry** installed, then install the project dependencies:

```bash
# From the ping-me/tier1/ directory
poetry install
```

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named **`.env`** inside the `ping-me/tier1/` directory. **Do not commit this file.**

It must contain the following variables:

```
# .env
# --- Twilio Credentials ---
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+15555551234
NOTIFICATION_PHONE_NUMBER=+15558675310 

# --- Flask Secret Key (Required for web app security) ---
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=a_random_key_for_local_testing
```

#### 3. Run the Application

Start the Flask development server using Poetry's run command, which executes the script within the isolated virtual environment:

```bash
poetry run python src/tier1/app.py
```

---

### How to Run

1.  Open your web browser to the displayed address (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
2.  Click the **"Send Message ðŸš€"** button.
3.  The **Python console** will log the API call, and the UI will display a success or failure message.

### What I Learned

* **Secure Credential Loading**: Successfully implemented `python-dotenv` and confirmed environment variables are loaded securely into the Flask application context.
* **Centralized Error Handling**: Created a robust initial check to ensure all four required environment variables are present before attempting to instantiate the Twilio client, providing a clear error message as required.
* **Web Framework Basics**: Established a minimal, functional Flask application that handles routing (`/`), form submission (`POST`), and displays real-time status updates using **Bootstrap 5** and Flask's `flash` messaging system.
